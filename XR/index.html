              <p>Digital worlds certainly seem to be increasingly more integrated with physical
                worlds, and the boundaries between the two are inarguably porous in our present moment . Already we see
                various forms of physical performance from theater to boardroom meetings adapting to a virtual format. I
                am struck by how access to virtual “togetherness” keeps us together at this time, it’s difficult to
                imagine if we would be able to coordinate as effectively without the assistance of webcams, living
                documents, and digital entertainment. However, I think this increasingly digital world also exposes
                perhaps a misleading rhetoric around what we mean by “connecting”. Adapting from the physical to an
                online format feels in some ways like an athletic feat. We are all training to compete in a changing
                world where the vulnerabilities of our bodies are driving our decision making. It seems to me that the
                same structural inequalities that separate us in our physical world similarly affect our access to
                presence online and yet are further concealed by the design and branding of the platforms that now
                mediate every virtual relationship and so right now I am very interested in what it means for people to
                be “failing“ as digital athletes.</p>
                <br>
                Even apart from our current circumstances, long distance “togetherness” for the purpose of collaboration
                depends upon the infrastructures that connect us. The many pieces of software and hardware that craft a
                network of inputs and outputs- moderated by internet bandwidths- moderated by variability of our network
                providers- moderated by incomes or institutional support- moderated by time zones- moderated by platform
                community standards- moderated by government firewalls and propaganda engines- moderated by our desire
                to experiment, to play, to make meaning, to fool around... So when we encounter failures, or when the
                system chews up our intentions and spits out something that deprives us of our means to communicate, the
                digital world reinforces power structures that have unevenly distributed technical literacy and network
                infrastructure.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Digital artists play an important role in revealing this devil in the details, and have been long before
                the covid19 outbreak. Live broadcasting, cam- ing , etc are crafts that have long been tackling the
                beast of “real-ness”. However, for myself I am wondering what successful achievement of a digital
                athleticism in this realm offers us at this moment. Perhaps community building, but I am skeptical of
                that as the primary outcome. In my view it feels more like a pursuit of understanding the influence of
                the network infrastructures in the medium itself. Internet providers, teleconferencing software, social
                media platforms etc are all sponsoring our collective spring training seasons. Are we going to webcam
                state? Telepresence nationals? Quarantine olympics? How do we include our losses, injuries, or missteps
                in the narratives of our path to victory? Or rather, what do our virtual failures do to the presence of
                an audience rooting for you?
